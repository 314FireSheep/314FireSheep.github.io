## Overview

Vision: A visually clean ordering page for users to easily place orders with Full Cycle Takeout.

Full Cycle Takeout - A pilot program by the non-profit Zero Waste Oâ€™ahu (Zero Waste Hawaii).

Their mission is to reduce the waste produced by single-use containers and utensils by renting out re-usable ones. Having a web application will be able to reduce the burden on both customers and the organization.

This applications can be modified and applied more generally for use in other places like in UH. Supporting for their own rental or loan services with different types of items.

### Tech Stack

- Meteor for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
- React for component-based UI implementation and routing.
- React Bootstrap CSS Framework for UI design.
- MongoDB NoSQL database program for saving data generated by users.

## Development History

Starting the project for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge 2023, the code was developed utilizing things outside the required tech stack for the ICS 314 project. 

So using UH Bowfolios as a template, we started converting our HACC project into the required tech stack of ICS 314.
