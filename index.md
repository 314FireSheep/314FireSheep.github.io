## Plan Overview

Vision: A visually clean ordering page for users to easily place orders with Full Cycle Takeout.

Full Cycle Takeout - A pilot program by the non-profit Zero Waste Oâ€™ahu (Zero Waste Hawaii).

Their mission is to reduce the waste produced by single-use containers and utensils by renting out re-usable ones.

### Page for placing a order
- Have images and descriptions for each item
- Buttons and input for each container to modify count.

### Confirmation page for an order
- Gives an overview of their order.
- Think about a checkout for online retail.

### Sign-in / -up / -out page
- As its name implies handles user verification.
