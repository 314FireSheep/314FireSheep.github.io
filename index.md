## Overview

Vision: A visually clean ordering page for users to easily place orders with Full Cycle Takeout.

Full Cycle Takeout - A pilot program by the non-profit Zero Waste Oâ€™ahu (Zero Waste Hawaii).

Their mission is to reduce the waste produced by single-use containers and utensils by renting out re-usable ones. Having a web application will be able to reduce the burden on both customers and the organization.

This applications can be modified and applied more generally for use in UH. For their own rental or loan services.

### Tech Stack

- Meteor for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code.
- React for component-based UI implementation and routing.
- React Bootstrap CSS Framework for UI design.
- MongoDB NoSQL database program for saving data generated by users.

## User Guide
Descriptions of the pages a user will be able to interact with.

### Sign-up/ -in/ -out page
Will be in a drop-down on a navigation bar. The choices will vary based on sign-in status (signed in or not).

Sign up: User will input their desired username and password. If the username does not exist already, the account will be created and the user will be signed in.

## Development History

Starting the project for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge 2023, the code was developed utilizing things outside the required tech stack for the ICS 314 project. 

So using UH Bowfolios as a template, we started converting our HACC project into the required tech stack of ICS 314.
